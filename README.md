# SpeechRec
A java application to turn verbal words into text file

Description:
A desktop application that takes user voice input and converts it into code on the code editor.

Inspiration:
People with difficulties of typing like some disabilities or simply breaking arms could not really code. Some of our friends suffered these problems, which make them extremely frustrated. Thinking about making coding easier and more available to every user, we make this app happen!

What it does:
Our project allows the users to code without really typing anything on the keyboard, in other words, it converts their speech into code on the code editor. In details, after recording a short audio file, the audio file will be analyzed to text file and then code.

How we built it:
We built it using Java APIs and Google Cloud Platform
